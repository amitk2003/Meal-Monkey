### **4. Analysis & Interpretation**

- **Cached Scenario**:
  - Response times were consistently low, with nearly all requests resolved in under 10 ms.
  - Session durations remained short and predictable, indicating quick turnarounds from server to client.
  - Redis cache offloaded the database effectively, showing excellent performance even under load.

- **Non-Cached Scenario**:
  - Each request had to query the database, leading to significantly higher and more variable response times.
  - Mean and median response times increased by an order of magnitude.
  - Peak response times showed that under load, the backend can become a bottleneck.

### **5. Conclusion**

Caching using Redis resulted in a dramatic improvement in system performance. With caching enabled, latency was reduced by over 80–90% across most metrics. This level of optimization not only enhances user experience but also enables the backend to scale more effectively under concurrent load.

For endpoints that serve semi-static or frequently requested data, implementing Redis caching is a critical performance enhancement strategy. In production environments, this could significantly reduce infrastructure costs and improve service reliability.
